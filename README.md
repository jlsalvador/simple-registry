# 📦 Simple Registry

A lightweight OCI-compatible container registry with RBAC support and pull-through caching.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **🎖️ OCI Native:** Implements the [OCI Distribution Specification v1.1.1][oci-spec].
- **🪶 Lightweight:** Low memory footprint and minimal dependencies.
- **🛂 Granular RBAC:** Fine-grained control per repository, action, and role.
- **📦 Pull-through Caching:** On-demand caching from external registries.
- **🔒 Flexible Authentication:** Anonymous access, Basic Auth, and time-bound Bearer tokens.
- **🌀 Stateless & Scalable:** High availability supported when backed by shared storage.

---

## 🏗️ Status

The core functionality is stable, and OCI conformance is actively being validated.

- ✅ Completed:
  - Core push/pull
  - RBAC, and Auth models.
  - Pull-through cache.
- 📆 Upcoming:
  - Garbage collection of unused blobs.
  - The internal YAML configuration schema is still evolving and may change in
    backward-incompatible ways before v1.0.

Pull requests are welcome.

## 🏁 Quick Start

### 1. Secure Your Credentials

Generate a secure password hash for your YAML configuration:

```sh
simple-registry genhash > ./admin-password.txt
```

### 2. Launch the registry

Run the registry with a data directory and administrative credentials:

```sh
simple-registry serve \
  -datadir ./data \
  -adminname admin \
  -adminpwdfile ./admin-password.txt \
  -addr 0.0.0.0:5000
```

> **ℹ️ Note:** For production, use the `-cert` and `-key` flags to listen on `https://`.

```sh
# Generate a self-signed TLS certificate for testing purposes.
openssl req -new -x509 \
    -keyout tls.key \
    -out tls.crt \
    -days 36500 \
    -nodes -subj "/C=SE/ST=ES/L=Sevilla/O=ACME/CN=localhost"

simple-registry serve \
  -datadir /var/lib/registry \
  -adminname admin \
  -adminpwdfile ./admin-password.txt \
  -cert tls.crt \
  -key tls.key
```

### 3. Usage Example

```sh
# Login to your new registry
docker login localhost:5000

# Tag and push an image
docker tag busybox localhost:5000/library/busybox
docker push localhost:5000/library/busybox
```

## ⚙️ Configuration & RBAC

The registry is configured via YAML manifests.
You can split your configuration into multiple files and directories using the `-cfgdir` flag.

| Component | Description                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Storage   | Defines where the blobs and manifests are stored.        |
| Identity  | Definition of Users and Groups.                          |
| RBAC      | Rules linking roles and role-bindings to control access. |
| Cache     | Configuration for pull-through cache targets.            |

Example:

```sh
simple-registry serve \
  -cfgdir ./config \
  -cfgdir ./rbac \
  -cfgdir ./proxies
```

> **ℹ️ Note:** There are some manifests examples in [docs/examples](docs/examples)

## 🔒 Authentication Model

You can define, using regular expressions, which users and groups have access to specific repositories.

Simple Registry evaluates requests in three tiers:

1. **Anonymous:** Mix public/private repositories.
2. **Basic Auth:** Defines users and groups for basic authentication. Hash password by bcrypt.
3. **Bearer Token:** Supports issued tokens with built-in expiration validation.
